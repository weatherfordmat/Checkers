# Checkers

## Synopsis

This was a project that was completed as Part of The University of Texas at Austin Coding Bootcamp. During the course, we split up into groups and are given a couple of weeks to build something with a set of given technologies. 

We decided to build an online arcade. Our primary game is checkers in which you can play against the computer. We have also developed minesweeper and tic-tac-toe.

## What Technologies We Used

We used a variety of front and back end technologies to accomplish this.

Back End:
1. Sequelize: Sequelize helped us to validate our input, streamline our queries, and ultimately make tgeh process of interfacing with MySQL much easier;

2. Node + Express: Our Backend Routing System which allowed us to proxy requests from AWS API Gateway, set up routes for authentication, and interface with the lambda functions to create, read, update, and destory data in the mysql database;

3. AWS RDS: Amazon Web Services Hosted Our MySQL database;

4. Jade: Jade (aka Pug) was our primary templating langauge;

Front End:
1. D3: D3 was our central front-end library for creating the checkboard and pieces;

2. jQuery: DOM manipulation;

3. Auth0: A simple authentication service to allow for user registration, logging in, logging out, etc;

4. Bootstrap: General Styling and the Grid System;

## Motivation

This project helped us cement our understanding of how full stack projects are created.

## Installation

To run this project:

```javascript
//To Install
git clone https://github.com/weatherfordmat/Checkers.git
cd Checkers
rm .git
npm install

/*
1. Go to auth0.com create an account, create a 'client', and find your keys;
2. Add Your Appropriate Keys to the Server File and the Main Jade Template
*/

//To Start
npm start

//To test (Coming Soon)
npm run test 
```

## Future

Hash tables are notoriously fast, far faster than the browser computing the same moves over and over again. In a future edition of the game, for each move, we want to save teh board relative to the game difficulty and the corresponding move which was chosen (or even better the two or three best moves).

Also, the computer chooses the first available double jump and not necessarily the best. It also forces the player to do the same. We can add a `feedback loop` here to have the computer statistically delineate the unwritten rules of chosing the better jump without looking more moves ahead. This is more the essence of machine learning.
